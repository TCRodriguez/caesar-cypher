Design

I wanted to go for a terminal/console aesthetic, even Fallout console style with the black screen and sharp green color. (This green happens to be my favorite color as well :) ).

Another single-page design as it is a simple app. It is fully responsive as well at common viewport sizes for both desktop/laptop and mobile devices.

Future features/Ideas
-----------------------

I had initially wanted to change the caret to the familiar rectangular box to fully commit to that terminal/console aesthetic, though I decided to forego it for this iteration of this project as it involves plenty of JavaScript-fu that I didn't want to get hung up at this point in time.

Another feature I had in mind was, again to fully commit to the console representation, was to have any phrases decoded/encoded to stay in a "soft history" on the page as a type of running log of what the user's activity. Again, I decided against it for now.
